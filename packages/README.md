# Packages

Your task is to recreate the list of package on the [Your Golf Travel venue page](https://www.yourgolftravel.com/the-belfry)
using the fixtures provided.

## Instructions

* Clone the repo and `cd packages`. This project has been scaffolded with the Express Generator
with some basic modifications to include example data. You can install any extra packages/frameworks
you want by adding them to `package.json`.

* Run the server with `npm run watch` and visit `http://localhost:3000/`. The server will reload
changes automatically but you will need to refresh the browser.

* Recreate the packages using the JSON fixtures provided in the app. The packages can be found
at `http://localhost:3000/packages` and prices for a single package at `http://localhost:3000/packages/prices`.
