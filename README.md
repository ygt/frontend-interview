# Autocomplete

Your task is to create an autocomplete utilising the Your Golf Travel [venue API](www.yourgolftravel.com/api/).

## Mockups

The autocomplete should look like the following mockup:

## Instructions

* Clone the repo. Webpack is already included so you can run a dev server using `npm run start`. Sass is also included, should you wish to use it. You can install any extra packages you want.

* Create an autocomplete that shows a list of venues that have a name matching the user's input. The list of results should update dynamically as the input changes.

* Our public API provides an autocomplete endpoint here: www.yourgolftravel.com/api/autocomplete. You can provide a query term using a query parameter named `q` e.g. `/api/autocomplete?q=golf`.

* The 'submit' button does not need to have any functionality.

* Try to follow the mockup as closely as possible.
